# Java Mini Project

This project was made for the course CSD207 in the semester of Monsoon 2017.
The question is as follows,

Level 2 – Smart city
You are required to design your own classes, data members and methods for the below description. You would be designing the relationship between the objects yourself.
1. Design drones that can act as a cop, act as a tourist guide for people touring the city. 
2. A drone has the capabilities to take pictures/videos of suspected activities and store it for future references. A drone can intimate a cop if any suspected activities are detected.
3. A drone needs to have an inbuilt location system to report the location of suspected activities.
4. A drone acts as a tourist guide by helping tourists in locating the spots to visit in a city. Based on a particular user’s interest, the drone guides a user to avail transport facility to the location user wants to visit, to buy day to day things, to find a restaurants etc… The drone can also suggest places to visit in the city for a user. If the user likes Adventures, the drone suggests the user with some adventure activities in the city.
5. There can be many drones in the city with different functionalities.
6. You are required to implement the functionality of the drone, users to interact with the drone. Users could to travelers or cops or travel agents or cab agents.
7. Users should be able to interact with the drone by asking queries or showing pictures.
